NUT-Monitor is a graphical application to access and manage UPSes connected to
a NUT (Network UPS Tools) server.

This application (variants written in Python 2 + GTK2, and in Python 3 + Qt5)
uses the python-pynut class (available at http://www.lestat.st), delivered
as PyNUT in the NUT source tree.
