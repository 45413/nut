NUT-Monitor is a graphical application to access and manage UPSes connected to
a NUT (Network UPS Tools) server.

This application (variants written in Python 2 + GTK2, and in Python 3 + Qt5)
uses the python-pynut class (available at http://www.lestat.st), delivered
as PyNUT in the NUT source tree.

Refer to your OS packaging and/or install custom modules with `pip` (or `pip3`)
to get required dependencies (GTK + GObject or QT5).

For quick tests (e.g. during development), you can run the clients like this:
````
:; PYTHONPATH=../module/ python2 ./NUT-Monitor-py2gtk2.in
````
or:
````
:; PYTHONPATH=../module/ python3 ./NUT-Monitor-py3qt5.in
````
